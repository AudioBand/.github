# What is AudioBand?
AudioBand is an easy to use, highly customizable music player that sits right in your Taskbar!
It utilizes the extra white space you may have and turns it into something functional.

It supports Spotify, iTunes, MusicBee and the Windows Music API (almost all modern apps support this! [List Of Working Popular Apps](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts/blob/main/docs/GSMTC-Support-And-Popular-Apps.md))  
Is your app not supported? You can easily [create support for your app yourself](https://audioband.github.io/AudioBand/audiosource-docs/index.html) with an ever so slight coding knowledge, or kindly ask your coding friend to do it for you!

## Customizable, how?
You can customize the size of the toolbar, every button separately, their size, color, background, you name it!
